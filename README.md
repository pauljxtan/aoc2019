# Aoc2019

![Build status](https://github.com/pauljxtan/aoc2019/workflows/Elixir%20CI/badge.svg)

My solutions for Advent of Code 2019.

- To display all solutions so far, run `mix sols` (this will take a while)
- For a specific solution, run `mix sols [day] [part]` (e.g. `mix sols 4 2`)
- Run the tests with `mix test`

Developed on Elixir ~~1.8.1~~ 1.9.4.
